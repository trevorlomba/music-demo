# music-demo

The music-demo is a modular and scalable React project designed to provide affordable services to clients in the music industry. The project offers a more sophisticated and feature-rich alternative to the popular but simplistic linkt.ree service.

The application provides users with song previews and visualizers for multiple pieces of content, as well as the ability to access an artist's top links. To enhance the user experience and improve performance, I have implemented lazy loading content, controlled forms, and Context views.

To support the integration with the CommerceJS API, I have adhered to their documentation guidelines, ensuring that the integration is seamless and error-free. Furthermore, the application includes a Google Analytics integration to track traffic, while music streaming is facilitated by the React Howler component library.

Overall, the music-demo project is a testament to my expertise in React and my commitment to delivering top-notch services to clients in the music industry.
